            <p class="Reactpres">
                You may have been redirected to the official react website on        the homepage. React is in fact a front-end library often wrongly called framework. 
                It is now very widespread and used by many sites that you use every day like netflix, Airbnb, Facebook and many others.
                But why not use already existing frameworks like VueJS or Angular?
                The main goal of React is to build structured applications with reusable components.
                How? The philosophy of React is not to separate the html structure, the css style and the JS logic but to divide the application in complete components.
                React allows incredible performances but mainly to work as SPA : single page application, it means that react applications work on browser without needing to reload the page.
                I hope that this short introduction has made you curious and that you will go and test the various features of react.
